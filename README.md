# HalfLife-sounds-for-minecraft
Minecraft Java Edition Sound Pack that replaces some default Minecraft sounds

## Requirements:
- Half-Life 1 installed on your via Steam, the original version not Half-Life:Source.
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and on your system's `PATH`.
- Minecraft Java Edition.

## Install:
This mod needs to grab the sound files from Half-Life in order to use them. The files couldn't just be uploaded here because of legal issues.

1. Download this project and put the files *anywhere* but your resourcepacks folder for Minecraft.
2. In the project find the `installer` folder and open a terminal in that location.
3. Run 'java Install` and you will be greeted with a simple UI to help with the install.

### SETUP
The installer makes best guesses for where the files may be but you may have to set the directories yourself.
1. Select the directory where Half-Life's files are stored (something like `\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life`)
2. Select the directory where your Minecraft Resource Packs are kept (`/minecraft/resourcepacks`)

### CONVERT
This will convert all the Half-Life files to `.ogg` format and place them in the directory next to `installer`. (Takes about 5 minutes)

### DEPLOY
This will copy the mod folder into your resourcepacks folder. (Takes less than a second)
